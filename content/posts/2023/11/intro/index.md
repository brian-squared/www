Hello, World!

We are {{< brian2 >}}, competitors in the
[Pi Wars 2024](https://piwars.org/2024-disaster-zone/)
robotics competition. Welcome to our blog!

![Brian² Logo](images/logo.png)

{{< brian2 >}} is a team of two Brians (because two Brians are better than one):
[Brian Corteil](https://twitter.com/CannonFodder) and
[Brian Starkey](https://twitter.com/usedbytes).

We're both Pi Wars veterans, with Brian C having competed in 5 previous Pi Wars
competitions, and Brian S having competed in 3; and have decided to join forces
this year with our entry.

Our basic plan is to enter a Tiny 4WD-derived design, from Brian C's
[Coretec Robotics](https://coretecrobotics.co.uk/) - because, despite being its
creator, Brian C has never entered a Tiny in Pi Wars! (Though plenty of others
have).

There'll be a future post on the design and history of the Tiny 4WD chassis.
For now, the basic essentials are:

 * Overall chassis size, shape and design from a Tiny 4WD
 * Pimoroni N20 Micro Metal Gearmotors, with encoders, x4
 * Pimoroni Mecanum Wheels, x4
 * Pimoroni Motor 2040 quad motor driver
   * No, we aren't sponsored...
 * Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
 * Raspberry Pi Camera (precise version tbd)
 * Flashy lights
 * ★Sensors★ (exact complement tbd)
 * 2S Lithium battery (exact size/shape tbd)

Right now we have each built a broadly-the-same-but-slightly-different Tiny 4WD
using the parts above, and we'll be converging on a single final robot as we
progress.

There's much more to come... we're aiming for mostly autonomous, hopefully some
robot arm action, and zombie-slaying weaponry (of course).
